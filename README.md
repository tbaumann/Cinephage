## What is Cinephage?

Cinephage unifies your entire media workflow into a single, modern application. Instead of running multiple services that don't talk to each other, you get one cohesive platform that handles everything.

**One database.** All your movies, TV shows, live TV channels, subtitles, and indexer configs live together. No sync issues, no data fragmentation.

**One interface.** Browse, search, monitor, and manage everything from a single, responsive UI built with Svelte 5.

**One configuration.** Set up your indexers, download clients, and preferences once. They work across movies, TV, and streaming.

**One place.** Whether you're downloading a BluRay remux, streaming via .strm files, or watching live TV, it's all in Cinephage.

---

## What It Replaces

Cinephage brings together functionality you'd typically find across multiple applications:

- **Radarr & Sonarr** — Movie and TV series management
- **Prowlarr** — Indexer management with supported trackers
- **Bazarr** — Multi-provider subtitle management
- **Overseerr** — Content discovery and smart lists
- **FlareSolverr** — Built-in Cloudflare bypass (no external service needed)
- **Plus** — Live TV/IPTV management, usenet streaming, and more

The \*arr projects are fantastic at what they do. We just took a different path — one unified codebase instead of separate services that need to sync with each other.

## Key Features

### Stream Without Downloading

Create `.strm` files that point to online sources and watch instantly. No disk space, no waiting for downloads, no seeding. Works with Jellyfin, Emby, Kodi, or any player that supports .strm files.

### Built-in Cloudflare Bypass

Camoufox integration handles Cloudflare challenges automatically. No separate FlareSolverr container to maintain, no configuration headaches. It just works.

### Usenet Streaming

Stream directly from NZBs without downloading the entire file first. Unique seekable stream implementation with adaptive prefetching and segment caching.

### Live TV with Portal Discovery

Connect Stalker portals and automatically discover working MAC addresses. Full EPG support, channel management, and HLS streaming.

### Smart Quality Scoring

50+ scoring factors including codec efficiency (x265/AV1), HDR formats, audio quality, and release group reputation. Custom format creation for personalized scoring rules.

### Smart Lists

Dynamic content discovery with auto-add to library. Import from IMDb, Trakt, TMDb lists, or create custom queries. "Automatically add all 2024 movies rated 7.5+" — fully automated.

### Everything Else You'd Expect

- File watching and auto-import
- Multi-indexer search with deduplication
- 6 subtitle providers, 80+ languages
- 7 automated monitoring tasks
- Jellyfin/Emby notifications
- TRaSH Guides-compatible naming
