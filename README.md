## Quick Start

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoldyTaint/cinephage.git
cd cinephage
```

Create a `.env` file from the example (or use environment variables directly):

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to configure your settings (or edit `docker-compose.yaml` directly):

```bash
# Example .env file
CINEPHAGE_PORT=3000
CINEPHAGE_MEDIA_PATH=/path/to/your/media
CINEPHAGE_PUID=1000
CINEPHAGE_PGID=1000
CINEPHAGE_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

Then start it:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoldyTaint/cinephage.git
cd cinephage
npm install
npm run build
npm start

## AI Disclosure

This project was built with and continues to use AI assistance. As a solo developer who's still learning, AI makes it possible to tackle a project of this scope — something that would otherwise require a team. It's a personal project, and AI is a tool that helps bridge the gap between ambition and experience. It's not perfect, but neither am I. We believe in being upfront about how this project is built.
