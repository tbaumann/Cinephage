Cinephage takes a unified approach to media management. Movies, TV shows, indexers, subtitles, streaming, and live TV — all from a single interface backed by one database. Search, grab, organize, stream, and watch. One app, one place.

> **This project is under active development.** Features may be incomplete, APIs may change, and bugs are expected. This is a passion project by a solo developer — your patience and feedback are appreciated. Please report issues on GitHub, but understand that breaking changes may occur between updates.

## AI Disclosure

This project was built with and continues to use AI assistance. As a solo developer who's still learning, AI makes it possible to tackle a project of this scope — something that would otherwise require a team. It's a personal project, and AI is a tool that helps bridge the gap between ambition and experience. It's not perfect, but neither am I. We believe in being upfront about how this project is built.

## Legal Notice

Cinephage is a media management and aggregation tool. It does not host, store, or distribute any media content. Cinephage simply helps you organize your existing library and search external indexers and sources that you configure. What you do with this software is your responsibility.

**Live TV / IPTV**: Cinephage can discover and integrate with Stalker portals, but does not host or control any IPTV content. All streams come from external services. Support for this feature is limited as functionality depends entirely on third-party services outside our control.
