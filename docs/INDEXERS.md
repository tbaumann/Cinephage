# Indexers

Cinephage includes built-in support for torrent indexers using Cardigann-compatible YAML definitions. No external tools like Jackett or Prowlarr are required for basic functionality.

## Custom Indexers

Create definitions using Cardigann-compatible YAML.

### Creating a Definition

1. Create a YAML file in `data/indexers/definitions/`
2. Follow the Cardigann format
3. Restart Cinephage to load

### Example Definition

```yaml
id: example-indexer
name: Example Indexer
description: An example indexer definition
language: en-US
type: public

caps:
  categories:
    Movies: 2000
    TV: 5000

search:
  paths:
    - path: search
      method: get
  inputs:
    query: "{{ .Query.Q }}"

download:
  selectors:
    - selector: a.download-link
      attribute: href
```

### Definition Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `id` | Unique identifier |
| `name` | Display name |
| `description` | Brief description |
| `language` | Primary language code |
| `type` | `public` or `private` |
| `caps` | Supported categories and search modes |
| `search` | Search request configuration |
| `download` | Download link extraction |
| `login` | Authentication (private trackers) |

See existing definitions in `data/indexers/definitions/` for complete examples.

## Indexer Settings

### Rate Limiting

Each indexer has configurable rate limits:

- **Requests per minute**: Maximum API calls per minute
- **Cooldown**: Time to wait after rate limit hit

### Auto-Disable

Indexers that repeatedly fail are automatically disabled with exponential backoff:

| Failure | Cooldown |
|---------|----------|
| 1st | 5 minutes |
| 2nd | 15 minutes |
| 3rd | 1 hour |
| 4th+ | Up to 24 hours |

Re-enable manually in Settings after resolving issues.

### Health Monitoring

Monitor indexer health in **Settings > Integrations > Indexers**:

- **Status**: Enabled, disabled, rate-limited
- **Last Success**: Time of last successful search
- **Failure Count**: Consecutive failures
- **Response Time**: Average latency
