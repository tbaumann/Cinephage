# Indexers

Cinephage includes built-in support for ~20 torrent indexers using both Cardigann-compatible YAML definitions and native TypeScript implementations. No external tools like Jackett or Prowlarr are required for basic functionality.

> **Tip**: For indexers not built into Cinephage, use Torznab integration with [Prowlarr](https://prowlarr.com/) or [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett), which support 500+ indexers including sites with Cloudflare protection.

This document serves as both usage documentation and a comprehensive catalog of indexers in the torrent ecosystem.

## Using Indexers

### Enabling Built-in Indexers

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Indexers**
2. Browse available indexers
3. Toggle indexers on/off
4. Configure settings (API keys, credentials for private trackers)
5. Test each indexer to verify connectivity

### Torznab Integration

Connect to Prowlarr or Jackett for indexers without native support:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Indexers**
2. Click **Add Indexer** → **Torznab**
3. Enter connection details:
   - **Name**: Display name
   - **URL**: Prowlarr/Jackett URL
   - **API Key**: From your indexer manager
4. Test and save

**Example URLs:**

- Prowlarr: `http://localhost:9696/1/api`
- Jackett: `http://localhost:9117/api/v2.0/indexers/INDEXER_NAME/results/torznab`

---

## Custom Indexers

Create definitions using Cardigann-compatible YAML.

### Creating a Definition

1. Create a YAML file in `data/indexers/definitions/`
2. Follow the Cardigann format
3. Restart Cinephage to load

### Example Definition

```yaml
id: example-indexer
name: Example Indexer
description: An example indexer definition
language: en-US
type: public

caps:
  categories:
    Movies: 2000
    TV: 5000

search:
  paths:
    - path: search
      method: get
  inputs:
    query: '{{ .Query.Q }}'

download:
  selectors:
    - selector: a.download-link
      attribute: href
```

### Definition Structure

| Section       | Purpose                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | Unique identifier                     |
| `name`        | Display name                          |
| `description` | Brief description                     |
| `language`    | Primary language code                 |
| `type`        | `public` or `private`                 |
| `caps`        | Supported categories and search modes |
| `search`      | Search request configuration          |
| `download`    | Download link extraction              |
| `login`       | Authentication (private trackers)     |

See existing definitions in `data/indexers/definitions/` for complete examples.

---

## Indexer Settings

### Rate Limiting

Each indexer has configurable rate limits:

- **Requests per minute**: Maximum API calls per minute
- **Cooldown**: Time to wait after rate limit hit

### Auto-Disable

Indexers that repeatedly fail are automatically disabled with exponential backoff:

| Failure | Cooldown       |
| ------- | -------------- |
| 1st     | 5 minutes      |
| 2nd     | 15 minutes     |
| 3rd     | 1 hour         |
| 4th+    | Up to 24 hours |

Re-enable manually in Settings after resolving issues.

### Health Monitoring

Monitor indexer health in **Settings > Integrations > Indexers**:

- **Status**: Enabled, disabled, rate-limited
- **Last Success**: Time of last successful search
- **Failure Count**: Consecutive failures
- **Response Time**: Average latency
