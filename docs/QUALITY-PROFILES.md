# Quality Profiles

Cinephage uses a scoring system to evaluate and compare torrent releases, helping you get the best quality for your preferences.

## Built-in Profiles

Four profiles cover common use cases:

| Profile | Focus | Use Case |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Best** | Maximum quality | Remux, lossless audio, quality purists |
| **Efficient** | Quality with efficient encoding | x265/HEVC from quality groups |
| **Micro** | Quality-focused micro encodes | Small files, good quality |
| **Streaming** | Instant availability | Stream providers, auto-upgradeable |

### Best Profile

### Efficient Profile
