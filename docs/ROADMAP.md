---

## Current Focus

Features actively being developed.

### Streaming Provider Settings Integration

In Progress | High | **Area**: Streaming

Complete the integration of streaming providers with the settings system.

**Context**: The streaming provider infrastructure exists but isn't fully connected to the user-facing settings UI. This will allow users to enable/disable and configure streaming providers directly from the interface.

---

## Up Next

Features confirmed for upcoming releases.

### Usenet Client Support

Planned | High | **Area**: Download Clients

Add support for Usenet download clients: SABnzbd and NZBGet.

**Context**: Currently Cinephage only supports torrent downloads via qBittorrent. Adding Usenet support opens up a major alternative download method and enables the use of Usenet indexers (NZBGeek, DrunkenSlug, etc.).

**Dependencies**: Must be implemented before Usenet indexers can be used.

---

### Tag-Based Monitoring Profiles

Planned | Medium | **Area**: Monitoring

Implement tag matching for content-specific delay and upgrade profiles.

**Context**: Currently, delay profiles apply globally. This feature would allow different delay/upgrade rules based on content tags (e.g., longer delays for anime, immediate grabs for documentaries).

---

### Additional Public Indexers

Planned | Medium | **Area**: Indexers

Continue expanding built-in indexer support:
- The Pirate Bay
- EZTVx (EZTV mirror)
- ShowRSS
- Tokyo Toshokan
- AnimeTosho

**Context**: More indexer coverage means better search results and content availability. Many anime indexers have already been added (SubsPlease, Anidex, Nyaa).

---

### Notifications System

Planned | Medium | **Area**: Infrastructure

Implement notification support for various events:
- Download started/completed
- Import successful/failed
- Health check failures
- New content available

**Notification channels**:
- Discord webhooks
- Email (SMTP)
- Generic webhooks
- Pushover, Telegram, etc.

**Context**: Users want to be notified of important events without constantly checking the UI.

---

### Import Lists

Planned | Medium | **Area**: Library

Sync watchlists from external services:
- Trakt
- IMDb watchlists
- Letterboxd
- Plex watchlists

**Context**: Allows users to manage their "want to watch" list externally and have Cinephage automatically monitor those titles.

---

### Calendar View

Planned | Medium | **Area**: UI/UX

Visual calendar showing upcoming releases for monitored content.

**Context**: Provides at-a-glance visibility into when new episodes or movies are releasing. Similar to Sonarr/Radarr calendar functionality.

---

## Future Plans

Longer-term features under consideration.

### Multi-User Support

Under Consideration | Medium | **Area**: Infrastructure

Add user authentication and multi-user support:
- User accounts with login
- Role-based permissions
- Per-user settings and preferences
- Activity logging per user

**Context**: Currently Cinephage is single-user. This would enable shared instances for families or groups.

**Workaround**: Use reverse proxy authentication (e.g., Authelia, Authentik).

---

### Additional Download Clients

Under Consideration | Medium | **Area**: Download Clients

Support for additional torrent clients:
- Transmission
- Deluge
- rTorrent
- qBittorrent v5 API changes

**Context**: Users have different preferences for download clients. Supporting more clients increases flexibility.

---

### Docker Official Image

Under Consideration | Medium | **Area**: Infrastructure

Create and publish an official Docker image.

**Context**: Simplifies deployment for users who prefer containerized applications. Would include proper health checks, volume mounts, and environment variable configuration.

---

## Not Yet Started

Features on the horizon but not actively in development.

### Live TV / IPTV Support

Not Yet Started | Medium | **Area**: Streaming

Support for live TV streams and IPTV sources.

**Context**: Would enable users to integrate live television alongside their on-demand library. Requires significant infrastructure work for stream handling.

---

### Improved Cloudflare Handling

Not Yet Started | Medium | **Area**: Infrastructure

Better handling of Cloudflare-protected indexers.

**Context**: Many popular indexers use Cloudflare protection. Better integration with FlareSolverr or similar solutions would improve reliability. Currently, some protected sites may fail or require workarounds via Prowlarr.

---

### Music Support (Lidarr-style)

Not Yet Started | Low | **Area**: Library

Artist/album discovery, music indexers, audio quality profiles.

**Context**: Would extend Cinephage beyond video content. Requires integration with MusicBrainz for metadata and music-specific indexers.

---

### Books Support (Readarr-style)

Not Yet Started | Low | **Area**: Library

Book and ebook management with Library Genesis integration.

**Context**: Further extends the "all-in-one" vision to include written media. Would require book-specific metadata sources and indexers.

---

### Audiobooks Support

Not Yet Started | Low | **Area**: Library

Audiobook library management and metadata.

**Context**: Related to Books Support but with unique requirements for audio file handling and audiobook-specific metadata.

---

### Enhanced Streaming Provider Support

Not Yet Started | Medium | **Area**: Streaming

Deeper integration with streaming services for availability tracking.

**Context**: Currently shows watch providers from TMDB. Enhanced support could include real-time availability checking and cross-platform search.

---

### Additional Subtitle Providers

Not Yet Started | Low | **Area**: Subtitles

Expand subtitle provider support beyond the current 8 providers.

**Context**: More providers means better coverage for obscure content and languages.

---

## Known Limitations

Current acknowledged gaps and their workarounds.

### Torrent-Only Downloads

Known Limitation | High

Cinephage currently only supports torrent downloads. Usenet is not yet supported.

**Workaround**: None currently. Usenet support is high priority on the roadmap.

---

### Single User Only

Known Limitation | Medium

No built-in user authentication or multi-user support.

**Workaround**: Place Cinephage behind an authenticating reverse proxy like Authelia, Authentik, or Nginx basic auth.

---

### qBittorrent Only

Known Limitation | Medium

qBittorrent is the only supported download client.

**Workaround**: None. Users must use qBittorrent or wait for additional client support.
